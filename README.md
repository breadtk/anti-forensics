# anti-forensics
A collection of anti-forensics scripts for use on your daily machines. This
repository won't ever be comprehensive or fully effective in mitigating
everything as I'm not familiar with your specific use case, machine, or
software. Furthermore you probably shouldn't be doing sensitive stuff on your
daily machine.

In general the scripts in this directory approach anti-forensics from the
perspective of deleting/overwriting any potential evidence. I would still
recommend that you ensure you have sane software defaults/configuration, do not
generate information, and as a last resort do not write information to disk.

If you have thoughts on a missing platform or use case, please feel free to
submit a pull request.
